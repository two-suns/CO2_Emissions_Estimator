# Final_Project #
# Predict CO2 Emissions <br>
Overview: <br>
Using various vehicle data from the European Union (EU), predict CO2 emissions for a variety of vehicle and fuel types using machine learning. The UK has a ban on petrol and diesel cars that is set to take effect in 2030 as well as strict emissions standards. One such standard involves a tax that is relative to the amount of exhaust emissions, so more emissions leads to more cost for the customer (BuyACar Team, 2021). This makes it important for car manufacturers to be able to predict emissions of their vehicles to help reduce costs for their customers. Given several inputs, this model will attempt to predict fuel emissions so changes can be made in vehicle design to save customers more money. <br>
Other questions we hope to answer include:<br>
<br>
What inputs more accurately predict emissions? <br>
Which fuel type has the lowest emissions? <br>
What effect do different fuel modes have on emissions?<br>
<br>
Technology: <br>
Python, Jupyter Notebook, SQLite <br>
<br>
Communication Protocols:
<br>
The team will communicate mainly through Slack and Zoom meetings.
